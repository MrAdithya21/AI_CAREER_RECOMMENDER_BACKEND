# AI Career Recommender Backend

## Overview

This backend service powers the **AI Career Recommender** application. It processes user-uploaded resumes to extract skills, estimate experience, and generate personalized career recommendations leveraging AI and machine learning models.

Built using **FastAPI**, it offers fast, asynchronous REST APIs that integrate with various NLP models, embedding tools, and external APIs to deliver an intelligent and scalable career recommendation system.

## Features & Workflow

### 1. Resume Upload and Parsing
- Accepts PDF resumes uploaded by users.
- Parses textual content using libraries like `pdfminer.six` and `PyPDF2`.
- Estimates years of professional experience from parsed text.

### 2. Skill Extraction
- Uses transformer-based NLP models and curated databases to identify relevant technical and soft skills within the resume text.
- Supports extraction of multiple skill formats and synonyms for robust matching.

### 3. Embeddings and Semantic Search
- Converts extracted skills and resume content into vector embeddings using `sentence-transformers` or other embedding models.
- Performs semantic similarity matching with a comprehensive career taxonomy.

### 4. Career Matching and Recommendation
- Matches user profiles against a wide array of career roles.
- Uses AI-based scoring, ranking, and business logic to recommend best-fit careers.
- Outputs ranked career lists with detailed metadata and match confidence scores.

### 5. Salary Data Integration
- Retrieves up-to-date salary and compensation information for recommended careers.
- Data sourced from external APIs or internal datasets to provide financial insights.

### 6. REST API Layer
- Implements all features behind a clean, documented REST API built with FastAPI.
- Supports asynchronous requests for scalability and speed.
- Endpoints include resume upload, skill extraction, career recommendation, and salary info.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment tool (venv, virtualenv, conda, etc.)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd backend
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**

   * Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if provided).
   * Add your API keys, database URLs, and other secrets in `.env`.

5. **Run the backend server:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. **Access the API:**
   Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

   This opens the interactive Swagger UI to explore all available endpoints.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint             | Method | Description                         |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `/upload-resume`     | POST   | Upload a resume PDF for parsing     |
| `/extract-skills`    | POST   | Extract skills from resume text     |
| `/recommend-careers` | POST   | Generate career recommendations     |
| `/fetch-salary`      | GET    | Fetch salary data for given careers |

*Full API documentation is auto-generated and accessible via Swagger UI (`/docs`).*

## Dependencies

Key dependencies included in `requirements.txt`:

* **fastapi** and **uvicorn** – Web framework and server
* **transformers**, **sentence-transformers** – NLP and embedding models
* **pdfminer.six**, **PyPDF2**, **docx2txt** – Resume parsing
* **google-ai-generativelanguage** – Google generative AI API integration
* **sqlalchemy** – ORM for database operations
* **scikit-learn**, **numpy**, **scipy** – ML utilities and scientific computing
* **httpx**, **requests** – HTTP client libraries

Additional dependencies may include packages for data handling, caching, security, and asynchronous operations.

---

## Development Tips

* Use the interactive Swagger UI to test API routes during development.
* Logs are printed to console; consider adding file logging for production use.
* Write unit tests for core logic inside the `core/` directory for maintainability.
* Use environment variables to keep secrets and API keys secure.
* Modularize code further for adding new AI models or career data sources.

---

## Future Work

* Add user authentication and profile management.
* Implement caching and rate limiting for API efficiency.
* Extend salary data coverage and historical trend analysis.
* Fine-tune skill extraction with domain-specific datasets.
* Add detailed analytics dashboards for user insights.
